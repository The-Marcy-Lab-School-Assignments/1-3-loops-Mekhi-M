# Question

Look at this `break` statement:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i > 7) break;
  console.log(i);
}
```

Is there any way we could achieve the exact same functionality with a `for` loop, but _without_ using the `break` statement?

# Answer

Instead of using the break statement, the condition statement in the for loop initialization could be changed to check for i being less than 8 rather than less than 10.
